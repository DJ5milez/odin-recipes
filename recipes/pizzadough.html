    <p>Here's an easy recipe to make some vegan pizza dough. No need to order in with this recipe. Easy to throw together and tastes delicious</p>
    <p>Once the dough is made the world is your oyster and you can make any of your pizza favourites</p>
    <p>If you need a sauce, there's <a href="sauce.html">one right here.</a></p>
    <p><h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups all pupose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3><em>Method</em></h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let activate for 10 minutes – it should become foamy. If it's not foamy, then the yeast is may be too old or your water was too hot.</li>
        <li>Stir in oil and salt.</li> 
        <li>Mix in 1/2 cup flour at a time.</li> 
        <li>Knead (using your hands or a dough hook in a stand mixer) until it forms a cohesive ball. It will still be a little sticky but you should be able to pick it up as one piece. If it's far too sticky, add 1-2 more tablespoons of flour at a time until it comes together.</li>
        <li>Place the ball of dough into a large greased bowl. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm location for 1 hour or until doubled in size. I let my dough rise in the oven with JUST the oven light on.</li>
        <li>Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (make sure to remove the dough from the oven if you let it rise in there.)</li>
        <li>Punch the dough down and knead a couple of times until it becomes smooth and more firm. At this point, you can store the dough in the freezer or fridge until later…or make a pizza!</li>
        <li>To cook roll out the dough on a floured surface and poke the dough with a fork. Then pre-bake in an oven at 245 degrees(celsius) for 5-7 minutes before pulling it out and adding your sauce and toppings. Then bake for another 10-15 minutes</li>
    </ol>
